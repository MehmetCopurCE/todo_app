## About the project

This app allows users to record what to do and check if they have done it. In addition, an application screen has been designed that allows the user to see the previous and next days on the application screen. Flutter Riverpod was used in the state management part of the application. In this way, live data transfer is provided. In addition, the table calendar package allows the user to see todos in the form of a calendar.
